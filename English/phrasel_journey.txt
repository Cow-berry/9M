The journey was to Finland, Sweeden and Eestoniya. This destination was chosen by all our family. My father got away for 3 days to go to this journey/
I and my family set off this jorney last year. We travelled by ferry. 
First of all we assembled our laggage and kept it to port. Then we checked in it and went to ferry. After ferry took off we had a dinner and then went to sleep.
First destination was Finland. When we got off we felt cold.
Second was Sweeden. 
And the last was Eesonia. In Eesonia I drank a glog. Usually glog is an alckogol drink. But I saw a non-alckogol one and drank it. It was delecious.
happily our ferry didn't break down and all was excellent.
Knowing English languaege helped me to talk to other people.
The jorney ended when we got off the ferry in Sain-Petersburg

I liked all things, except delays in foreign ports. One of they was more than 3 hours!
