1) Ugh.. Never mind. You don't want to know what's happening.... Okay, I'll tell you. What do you think about it. Am I hiding here because I play hide-and-seek? Difinitely not. There is my history. 
 
I can't imagine history..


7) First of all I have never watched TV since my childhood. 
We [I and my parents] have had a TV for years. 
But for some reasons it had become boring. 
After that it had been laying on the table turn-offed. 
Once we looked at our TV and decided to bring it to my grandparents at dad's part. 
So we did. It was also in my childhood so i don't remember much. 
After tht important desicion I only could watch TV while visiting granparents. 
Every summer since age of 7 or 8 I go to my grandparents's datcha. 
I have already had my favourite program, but my family still haven't had TV and as I think never will.
