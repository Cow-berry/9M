\begin{frame}{Transport}
In any kind of transport you should not to leave rubbish. As far as i know, there is no enviromentally-friendly transport in my city, except trams.

\begin{frame}{Accomodation}
	There are lots of hotels, hostels and motels in my city.
	In those you also shouldn't leave rubbish and damage anything. You need to understand basic rules of acommodation, if you choose to live there.

\begin{frame}{Energy and water}
	You should conserve water and limit energy use (use energy-efficient things) to be more responsible.

\begin{frame}{Plants and wildlife}
	There are a lot of beautiful gardens in Saint-Petersburg. But when I think about wildlife, I picture mostly stray cats and dogs. Don't harm them and don't leave ribbish in the gardens.

\begin{frame}{Food}
	There are many food places. But if you bought any food and ate it, you should put the packaging in the trash can.

\begin{frame}{Resycling}
	Whenever you put the rubbish in the trash, it will be either recycled or second used for something.

\begin{frame}{Souvenirs}
	If you go to Saint-Peterburg, you should buy some matryoshkas and perhaps balalaika... and maybe vodka, too.

\begin{frame}{People and social interaction}
	In Saint-Petersburg you can find any kind of people (agressive or kind, evil or saint etc.). Because of it social intereaction can be very different with different people. 
	
	Here is an example of people union with one common idea, roller race:
